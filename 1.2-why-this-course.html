<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Why this course?</h2>
<p>Just before I started graduate school nearly a decade ago, a survey found that most early career ecologists lacked adequate quantitative training and 75% were not satisfied with their own understanding of ecological modeling. Ecology has always been heavily rooted in mathematics, and has become increasingly quantitative in recent decades, but graduate training has lagged behind that trend. I was lucky to have taken an Ecological Modeling course taught by two brilliant quantitative ecologists (and excellent human beings) - Morgan Tingley and Robi Bagchi - during my PhD at the University of Connecticut. This course is inspired by theirs, and similarly aims to train the next generation of quantitative ecologists.</p>

<p>One of the reasons I teach this course is because I think it is really important for students to really understand their data and how to properly analyze it to address their hypotheses. Too often, the way statistics is taught (including how I was first introduced to it as an undergrad) is very rigid, with strict rules to follow, assumptions to be met, and prescribed ways of doing things. Many of us have come across guidelines like these charts for how to pick the right statistical test for your data.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Martin-Jakob/post/What_Statistical_test_should_I_use/attachment/59d63e0dc49f478072ea8d9c/AS%3A273765781442574%401442282257641/image/statistical_tests.jpg" />
<img src="https://philipppro.github.io/images/Overview_statistical_tests.png" /></p>
<p>I also think that this approach to learning statistics instills a wariness about doing analyses ‘wrong’, which can turn many students away from statistics and modeling. I have absolutely no data to back this up, but I suspect the rigid way in which statistics is taught is one reason for a gender gap in quantitative ecology. Gender stereotypes can cause girls to internalize that they are ‘bad at math’ at an early age, which combined with a fear of not getting the ‘rules’ of statistics right, could be one reason why only 4% of early career women in ecology indicate being very involved in ecological modeling compared to 10% of men.</p>

</div>
<p>It is also really important for students to develop quantitative skills for their future employment prospects. For graduate students aiming for academic careers, quantitative skills can help them secure permanent positions. 40% of faculty job listings in ecology and related fields require some level of quantitative skills, and 21% require “strong” quantitative skills. Many industry and government research positions also require quantitative skills, including data analysis, visualization, and modeling.</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, learning how to code and build models opens up a whole new world of possibilities for asking interesting questions. More often than not, we address questions using the tools we have at our disposal (i.e. if you’ve got a hammer, everything looks like a nail). The type of statistical tests that students often learn are inadequate to deal with many of the questions and hypotheses in ecology and related fields. Instead of being constrained by what statistical tests will be possible with the data or cramming the data into a test that does not really fit, students can learn to build models that truly address their research questions, opening up the possibility for more novel hypotheses.</p>
